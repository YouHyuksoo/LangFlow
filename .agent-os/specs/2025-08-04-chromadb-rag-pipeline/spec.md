# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ChromaDB RAG Pipeline Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement ChromaDB-based vector database and complete RAG pipeline integration to replace existing JSON-based document storage with semantic search capabilities. This will transform the LangFlow system from 85% complete UI to a fully functional AI-powered knowledge management system with category-based document retrieval.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a company employee, I want to ask questions about documents in specific categories and receive accurate, contextual AI responses with source attribution, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manual document searching.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User selects one or more categories (품질, 인사, 제조, 기술, 영업, 물류, 총무, MES)
2. User enters a natural language question
3. System performs semantic search across selected categories using ChromaDB
4. System retrieves most relevant document chunks and generates AI response
5. User receives contextualized answer with source document references

### Administrative User Story  
As an administrator, I want uploaded PDF documents to be automatically processed and stored in ChromaDB with proper categorization, so that the knowledge base continuously grows and remains searchable.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin uploads PDF documents via the existing file upload interface
2. System extracts text, chunks documents intelligently
3. System generates embeddings and stores in ChromaDB with category metadata
4. System confirms successful processing and indexing
5. Documents become immediately searchable through the chat interface

## Spec Scope

1. **ChromaDB Integration** - Replace existing JSON vector storage with ChromaDB persistent client using single collection with metadata filtering
2. **Document Processing Pipeline** - Implement intelligent text chunking, embedding generation using OpenAI API, and metadata preservation
3. **Semantic Search Implementation** - Build category-aware semantic search with relevance scoring and source attribution  
4. **RAG Pipeline Completion** - Integrate retrieval with OpenAI chat completion for contextual response generation
5. **Service Layer Integration** - Update existing ChatService and FileService classes to use ChromaDB instead of JSON storage

## Out of Scope

- Multi-language document support (Korean PDF processing only)
- Custom embedding model training (use OpenAI embeddings)
- Real-time document collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard updates
- Langflow GUI integration (focus on backend API)
- Mobile app optimization
- Document versioning and change tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional RAG System** - Users can upload PDFs, ask questions, and receive accurate AI responses with source attribution through the existing chat interface
2. **ChromaDB Integration** - All document embeddings stored in ChromaDB with proper category-based filtering and metadata management
3. **Performance Improvement** - Query response time under 5 seconds for typical questions with semantic search replacing keyword matching
