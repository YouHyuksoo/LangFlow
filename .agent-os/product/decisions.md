## 2025-08-04: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build LangFlow-based RAG system for enterprise knowledge management with category-specific document organization and AI-powered search capabilities.

### Context

Traditional knowledge management systems fail to provide intelligent search and contextual answers from enterprise documents. Employees struggle to find relevant information quickly across departmental silos (Quality, HR, Manufacturing, Technology, Sales, Logistics, Administration, MES).

Current challenges:
- PDF documents scattered across departments without unified search
- Manual document categorization and retrieval processes
- Lack of intelligent question-answering capabilities
- No unified interface for cross-departmental knowledge access
- Time-consuming manual searches reducing productivity

### Rationale

**Technology Stack Selection:**

1. **FastAPI Backend**: Chosen for high-performance API development with automatic OpenAPI documentation, async support for LLM calls, and excellent Python ecosystem integration for AI/ML workflows.

2. **Next.js Frontend**: Selected for React-based development with server-side rendering, excellent TypeScript support, and optimal performance for enterprise applications.

3. **Langflow Integration**: Leveraged as a visual flow builder for RAG pipeline design, enabling non-technical stakeholders to understand and modify AI workflows while providing code export capabilities.

4. **Category-Based Architecture**: Implemented departmental document separation (Quality, HR, Manufacturing, Technology, Sales, Logistics, Administration, MES) to improve search relevance and response accuracy.

5. **Supabase Database**: Chosen for managed PostgreSQL with built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and seamless integration with modern web applications.

6. **shadcn/ui Component Library**: Selected for consistent, accessible, and modern UI components with dark mode support and enterprise-grade design patterns.

**Architectural Decisions:**

- **Vector Database Separation**: Each department maintains separate vector databases to improve search precision and reduce cross-contamination of results
- **RAG-First Approach**: Prioritize retrieval-augmented generation over fine-tuning for faster implementation and easier maintenance
- **Category Selection UX**: Require users to select categories before querying to optimize search scope and improve relevance
- **Modular Component Design**: Enable independent development and testing of document processing, search, and UI components

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Traditional Knowledge Management (SharePoint, Confluence)**
   - Rejected: Limited AI capabilities, poor search experience, high licensing costs
   
2. **Custom LLM Fine-tuning Approach**
   - Rejected: Higher complexity, longer development time, expensive training costs, harder to maintain
   
3. **Single Vector Database for All Documents**
   - Rejected: Lower search precision, category mixing, harder to optimize for specific domains
   
4. **Pure Langflow GUI Approach**
   - Rejected: Limited customization for enterprise needs, dependency on Langflow UI for all operations

### Expected Positive Consequences

1. **Improved Knowledge Discovery**: 70-80% reduction in time to find relevant information through intelligent search
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: Employees can get contextual answers instead of reading entire documents
3. **Better Cross-Department Collaboration**: Unified interface enables knowledge sharing across silos
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Category-based design allows independent scaling of departmental knowledge bases
5. **Future-Proof Technology**: Modern stack enables easy integration of new AI capabilities
6. **Maintainable Codebase**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design for long-term sustainability

### Known Tradeoffs

1. **Initial Development Complexity**: Building custom RAG system requires more upfront development than off-the-shelf solutions
2. **LLM API Costs**: Ongoing operational costs for OpenAI API usage based on query volume
3. **Vector Database Management**: Requires ongoing maintenance of multiple category-specific vector databases
4. **User Training Required**: Employees need training on category selection and optimal query formulation
5. **Dependency on External Services**: Reliance on OpenAI API availability and Supabase infrastructure
6. **Performance Considerations**: Large document volumes may require optimization of vector search and indexing

### Success Metrics

- User adoption rate >80% within 3 months
- Average query response time <5 seconds
- User satisfaction score >4.0/5.0
- Document retrieval accuracy >85%
- Reduction in support tickets for document location requests >60%

## 2025-08-04: Implementation Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement advanced UI-first development approach with comprehensive component architecture and service layer separation, achieving 85% MVP completion before full RAG integration.

### Context

During implementation, several architectural decisions emerged that significantly impact the system's scalability, maintainability, and user experience:

1. **Frontend-First Development**: Complete UI implementation before backend AI integration
2. **Component Architecture**: Extensive use of shadcn/ui with custom business logic components
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: Clear separation between API routes, service classes, and data models
4. **Category-Centric UX**: Make category selection a required first step in user workflow

### Technical Implementation Decisions

**Frontend Architecture:**
- **Component Composition Pattern**: Built modular components (CategorySelector, FileUpload, ChatInterface) with clear prop interfaces
- **State Management Strategy**: Used React hooks with local state management, preparing for global state when needed
- **TypeScript-First Approach**: Strict typing throughout with custom interfaces for business entities
- **Responsive Design Priority**: Mobile-first design ensuring cross-device compatibility

**Backend Service Architecture:**
- **Service Layer Separation**: Created dedicated service classes (ChatService, FileService, LangflowService) for business logic
- **API Route Simplification**: Keep API routes thin, delegate complex logic to service layer
- **Pydantic Model Integration**: Use Pydantic for request/response validation and automatic API documentation
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized environment-based configuration with type safety

**Database Design Decisions:**
- **Category-Based Data Separation**: Each category maintains separate document collections and vector stores
- **JSON Configuration Storage**: Store category definitions in JSON for easy management and updates
- **Metadata-Rich File Storage**: Comprehensive file metadata including processing status and error tracking

**Development Workflow:**
- **Concurrent Development**: Enable simultaneous frontend/backend development with mock data
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build working UI first, then integrate real AI capabilities
- **Error-First Design**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback from start

### Rationale

1. **User Experience Priority**: Building complete UI first ensures optimal user experience design before technical constraints
2. **Parallel Development**: Allows frontend and AI integration work to proceed simultaneously
3. **Risk Mitigation**: UI/UX risks are resolved early, reducing late-stage design changes
4. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Complete UI enables meaningful stakeholder review and iteration
5. **Technical Validation**: Service layer architecture validates before complex AI integration

### Implementation Evidence

**Completed Frontend Features (85%):**
- Complete chat interface with message history and source attribution
- Advanced category selector with document counts and recommendations
- File upload system with progress tracking and error handling
- Admin dashboard with statistics visualization
- Theme system with persistent user preferences

- Configuration management with environment variables
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes

**Category System (90%):**
- 8 predefined categories with visual branding
- Category-based UI workflow requiring selection before queries
- Document counting and statistics per category
- Category management API endpoints

### Success Indicators
